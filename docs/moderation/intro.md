# Moderation Guidelines

:::tip
As a staff member, it is important to be consistent in giving punishments and to ensure that players understand why they are being punished. This prevents players from receiving different punishments for the same offense, keeping it fair for everyone.
:::

:::warning
An overview of the punishments follows for each offense. We write down #1, #2, or #3 after a warn to count a repeat of an offense within a category. This helps other staff members in the future to give an appropriate punishment if an offense is repeated by someone.
:::

:::danger
Punishments are only visible to staff members by default. By using '-p' after a punishment, it can be made public so everyone can see it in the chat. Use this in situations where you also want to warn others about the consequences of breaking the rules.
:::

Note: Once a punishment has been made i.e. ban/mute/warn it must be recorded in the `#notes` Discord channel. You can additionally make notes in game with the command `/notes add [user] [punishment reason]`. Make sure that the note written gives an explaination about why the player has banned. It is advised that you attatch a screenshot of the punishment in the thread connected to the note.
